# SP23-Assessing-The-Impact-Of-Design-Elements-On-VR-Users--Comfort-Levels

The current state of virtual reality head mounted displays (VR/HMD) suffers from several issues that prevent wider adaptation. A key hurdle facing VR is user discomfort in the form of visual fatigue, eye strain, and related sensations. Methods for mitigating visual discomfort have been developed and implemented, however there is much to be desired. This paper explores the impact of the brightness and temperature of lighting in a VR environment. Through assessing user responses to manipulated lighting variables, this experiment will demonstrate which aspects of lighting cause a user less visual discomfort. Optimizing the temperature of lighting will reduce user discomfort, improving the overall user experience of VR.
